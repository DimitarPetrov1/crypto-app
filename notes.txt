bugs:
Done 0. searching tokens that don't support usd get error, need to fetch the token data (tokenpage by another link form coingecko)
1. sparkline in homepage, when click does not fetch, i've put a prevent default so it won't break the fetch
2. optimize the fetch in home page
3. refreshing tokens page : 'No routes matched location "/token/bitcoin"'
4. handle very large numbers (small like baby doge coin)
5. sorting by volume asc does not work
6. loading on osrt does not show loader but looks okay 

to add: 
1. last update date for all tokens list (for search)
